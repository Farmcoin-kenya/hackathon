ASSUMPTIONS
1 ACRE == 50 BAGS OF MAIZE
1 BAG == 100KG
1 KG == 1000
since at this point im unable to distinguish between a token and a coin well ill just use shilingi to reduce on the confusion


IDEA
just the same way our normal notes(fifty 100 ,200 ) have the day they were printed

our shilingi will have a season stamp e.g may-june 2018 

and each season will have like its own shilingi

for example 
shilingi - (season code e.g 6 -18) is the one for may - june 2018
shilingi - (season code e.g 1 -18)  is the one for jan - feb 2018
and so on
also the season code is added so that the shilingi of that season can gain intrest individually

and now since we are saying that this shilingi is an asset we will give it a certain value eg 10k

since if we start capping it to bags we will have to make a shillingi for each cerial.

so when the farmer clocks in his goods .. they are weighed and valued 

so lets say he sold bags of different cerial worth 500k 

it would be 500/10 = 50 shilingi + (season code e.g 6 -18)

WHAT THEY CONTAIN
Users - normal account details

seasons - all the seasons and the amount the government offered per bag per cerials

cerials - the cerials that the government deals with 

bags - the number of bags the farmer sold in that particular season 

shilingi - it will contain the seaaso
STEPS
1. Account creation
2. farm registration
3. selling process
4. redeeming


HOW IT WILL WORK
1. ACCOUNT CREATION
So if i dont have an account ill have to create one before im able to do anything



The details that would be taken are : 
#this shall be populated


once i have an account 

2. FARM REGISTRATION
Prior to selling of maize every farmer will have to create an account and tell us where his farm is situated and the size of the farm and evidence that he owns the farm or has leased the farm

this will ensure that the farmer will give us cerials that he can produce

like if one has an acre he should give us a max of 50 bags of maize and he shouldnt be able to sell to the ncpb more than that.

then the farms will have to be verified by agric officers

this will also help in the projection of seeds,fertilizer and expected harvest of each cerial also an accurate data map of what is grown where.

3. SELLING PROCESS
When a new season comes up and the government annonces that it wants to buy cerials.
 We will all go to sell(this is to those that have accounts).

After the bags are weighed/ counted the system checks if thats something one can handle.
i.e if my farm was one acre i should only be able to sell 50bags MAX.

then the bags are weighed and valued and converted into kshs 

50*100*100 = 500000 kshs

then if the government is able to pay a certain percentage it pays

lets say the government offered farmers instant payment of 30% of their sales so it will be 

(500000/100)*30 = 150000

with the remainder (350000) converted into the token so that it can gain intrest
the conversion will be 

350000/10000 = 35 shilingis

since they have a certain value they are able to be broken down into smaller chunks and also into decimals 

4. redeeming
